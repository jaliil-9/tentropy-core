# TENTROPY | AI System Design

This is the open-source core of [TENTROPY](https://tentropy.co), a platform for improving AI system design through realistic system architecture challenges.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real Simulation**: Challenges run in isolated Firecracker micro-VMs (via E2B).
- **System Design Focus**: Tests latency, memory usage, and race conditions, not just algorithms.
- **Modern Stack**: Next.js 15, Supabase, TailwindCSS.
